# KNOW YOUR CAMPUS

social platform for students by students

### Intention behind this project

I have faced a lot of trouble knowing a lot of things that's been happening in my college, like different clubs / socities eg. coding society, dance society etc. I had to ask a ton of seniors for advice at the start of the semester to choose the subjects and for preparing the exams. 

The main aim of this project is to make platform where students can freely share their knowledge, experience and have fun while using this.
